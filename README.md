### üåü Importance of Identifying Design Properties
When working with mockup designs in Figma, identifying **color styles and typography properties** is crucial because:

- **Efficiency:** Developers and designers can reuse predefined styles instead of recreating them.  
- **Brand Identity:** Colors and typography form a visual language that reflects the brand‚Äôs personality.  
- **Accessibility:** Proper color contrast and readable typography improve usability for all users.  
- **Scalability:** Maintaining design tokens (colors, fonts, sizes) makes it easier to expand the system later.
